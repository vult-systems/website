        My 3D art practice spans character design, environment creation, prop modeling, and 3D printing. 
        Each piece represents an exploration of form, texture, and narrativeâ€”from stylized characters to 
        detailed architectural spaces. Browse by category below to view specific collections, or scroll 
        through all work to see the full range of my artistic process.
