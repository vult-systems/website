## The Challenge

Teaching technical art is unique. You're bridging two worlds: artistic intuition and technical precision.

## Show, Don't Just Tell

Live demos beat slides every time. Let students see the mistakes, the iteration, the real process.

## Build From First Principles

Don't skip the "why." When students understand the underlying logic, they can solve problems you never covered.

## Key Lessons

1. **Start Simple**: One concept at a time
2. **Real Projects**: Use actual production scenarios
3. **Document Everything**: Your notes become their reference
4. **Encourage Questions**: The "dumb" question is often the best one

## The Reward

Watching students go from "I don't get it" to building their own systems is incredibly satisfying.

## Moving Forward

I'm always refining my approach. Every class teaches me something new about how to explain these concepts better.
