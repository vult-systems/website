## The Goal

I needed a portfolio site that felt like *me* - minimal, fast, and focused on the work. No unnecessary complexity, just clean presentation of art, code, and writing.

## Tech Stack

After researching options, I landed on:

- **[Astro](https://astro.build)** - Perfect for content-focused sites
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** - Utility-first styling
- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)** - Component patterns
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com)** - Enhanced markdown for blog posts

Why Astro? It ships zero JavaScript by default, but lets you add interactivity where needed. Perfect for a portfolio.

## The Build Process

### 1. Setting Up the Foundation

Started with Astro's basic template and added Tailwind:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
npx astro add tailwind
```

Simple. Clean. Fast.

### 2. Content Collections

Astro's content collections are brilliant. I organized everything into three types:

```
src/content/
├── art/      # Portfolio pieces
├── log/      # Blog posts
└── projects/ # Case studies
```

Each collection has type-safe frontmatter. TypeScript catches mistakes before they reach production.

### 3. Design System

I used [shadcn/ui blocks](https://shadcnblocks.com) as inspiration for the layout. Key pages:

**Homepage (Hero1 pattern)**
- Side-by-side layout
- Clear CTAs
- Professional but approachable

**Art Gallery (Grid pattern)**
- 3-column responsive grid
- Hover effects on cards
- Category badges

**Blog (Blog grid pattern)**
- 2-column cards
- Featured images
- Clean typography

### 4. Performance Optimization

Getting 100/100 on Lighthouse was important:

- Optimized images with Astro's `<Image />` component
- Added proper meta tags and Schema.org data
- Implemented view transitions for smooth navigation
- Used lazy loading for below-the-fold content

Here's a comparison of load times:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| First Contentful Paint | 2.1s | 0.8s |
| Largest Contentful Paint | 3.4s | 1.2s |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | 0.15 | 0 |

### 5. Adding Interactivity

Most of the site is static, but I added React for:

- Dark mode toggle
- Art gallery filters
- Animated dot background
- Analytics tracking

React components are only loaded where needed, keeping the main bundle tiny.

## Deployment

Deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) because it's dead simple:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repo to Vercel
3. Done

Automatic deployments on every push. Preview URLs for branches. Perfect workflow.

## The Workflow GIF

Here's what the dev process looks like in real-time:

*Edit, save, hot reload. Instant feedback.*

## Key Learnings

**1. Start Simple**
Don't over-engineer. I started with basic pages and added features as needed.

**2. Content First**
Built the content structure before worrying about fancy animations. Got the fundamentals right.

**3. Use Existing Patterns**
shadcn/ui blocks saved hours of design work. No need to reinvent common patterns.

**4. Optimize Early**
Performance from day one is easier than retrofitting later.

**5. Document as You Go**
I wrote these blog posts while building. Fresh insights while it's all in working memory.

## Resources

Here's what helped me along the way:

- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build) - Excellent documentation
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Comprehensive reference
- [shadcn/ui Blocks](https://shadcnblocks.com) - Pre-built component patterns
- [Vercel Docs](https://vercel.com/docs) - Deployment guides

## The Result

A site that:
- ✅ Loads in under 1 second
- ✅ Scores 100/100 on Lighthouse SEO
- ✅ Works perfectly in dark mode
- ✅ Feels fast and responsive
- ✅ Is easy to maintain and update

## What's Next?

Planning to add:
- Case studies with more detail
- Tutorial series on Houdini workflows
- Analytics integration (Plausible or Umami)
- Newsletter signup
