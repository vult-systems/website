## The Idea

What if we use each tool for what it does best?

**Houdini**: Procedural generation, simulation, technical heavy lifting  
**Blender**: Artistic refinement, shading, final renders

## The Test

Building a procedural city generator:
- Houdini handles building placement, road networks, utility distribution
- Export to Blender for material work, lighting, final composition

## Initial Results

**Pros:**
- Faster iteration in Houdini
- Better artistic control in Blender
- Leverages strengths of both tools

**Cons:**
- Transfer overhead
- Need to maintain two files
- Version sync challenges

## Current Status

Still experimenting. The workflow shows promise but needs refinement. Considering building custom exporters to smooth the transition.

## Next Steps

- Test with larger scenes
- Automate the export/import process
- Document best practices

*This is a work in progress. Updates coming soon.*
