## The Problem

Procedural systems are powerful, but they can be intimidating for artists who just want to adjust one thing.

## The Solution

Custom attributes with sensible names and ranges.

## Example

Instead of exposing raw noise parameters:

```python
# Bad: Technical and unclear
frequency = 0.347
octaves = 4.2
lacunarity = 2.1
```

Create artist-friendly controls:

```python
# Good: Clear intent
terrain_roughness = 0.5  # 0 = smooth, 1 = very rough
detail_level = 0.7       # 0 = simple, 1 = complex
variation = 0.3          # 0 = uniform, 1 = varied
```

## Implementation in Houdini

1. Create a parameter interface
2. Remap values to technical parameters
3. Add clear labels and tooltips
4. Set sensible min/max ranges

## The Result

Artists can iterate quickly without needing to understand the underlying math. Win-win.

## Bonus Tip

Include presets! "Smooth Plains," "Rocky Hills," "Mountain Range" - instant starting points for exploration.
