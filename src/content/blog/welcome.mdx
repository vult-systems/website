## Why Keep a Log?

This space exists to document the creative process—not just the finished work, but the exploration, experimentation, and occasional failures that make up the craft. A place for:

- **Process notes** on how things are made
- **Experiments** that may or may not work out  
- **Technical deep-dives** into tools and workflows
- **Reflections** on the practice itself
- **Work-in-progress** updates and behind-the-scenes

## What to Expect

Entries will be irregular, honest, and focused on the work. Some will be visual, some technical, some contemplative. All will be authentic to where I am in the process.

This isn't about perfection—it's about practice, curiosity, and continuous learning.

## Moving Forward

More entries coming soon. The log begins here.
