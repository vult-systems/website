## Concept

A procedural cityscape exploring cyberpunk aesthetics with emphasis on neon lighting and atmospheric fog. Built entirely with Houdini's procedural systems for infinite variation.

## Technical Approach

The buildings use a modular procedural system:
- Base structure generation with controlled randomization
- Window pattern distribution using attribute-driven placement
- Neon sign generation with custom HDAs
- Atmospheric effects with volume rendering

## Lighting & Atmosphere

Key lighting features:
- Volumetric fog for depth and atmosphere
- Neon lights as primary light sources  
- HDRI environment for ambient fill
- God rays through fog volumes

## Results

The procedural approach allows for rapid iteration and variation while maintaining visual consistency across the entire scene.
