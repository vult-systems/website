## Series Overview

A collection of digital sculptures exploring the intersection of geometric precision and organic randomness.

## Methodology

Each piece follows a consistent approach:
- Start with basic geometric primitives
- Apply procedural deformation systems
- Add surface detail through displacement
- Finalize with material variation

## Surface Treatment

The surfaces combine multiple techniques:
- Voronoi fracture patterns for texture
- Procedural displacement for depth
- Metallic materials with variation
- Geometric patterns as accent details

## Presentation

Rendered in multiple views:
- Turntable animations for 360Â° viewing
- Still hero shots for portfolio
- Detail renders showing surface quality
- Lighting setups emphasizing form

## Artist Statement

These pieces represent an ongoing exploration of how mathematical precision can create unexpectedly organic results.
