## Character Design

A fantasy warrior combining heavy plate armor with flowing cloth elements. Focus on readability and strong silhouette.

## Sculpting Process

High-resolution sculpting workflow:
- Primary forms blocked in ZBrush
- Secondary detail pass for armor dents and wear
- Tertiary detail using surface noise and alphas
- Cloth simulation in Marvelous Designer

## Texturing

PBR texturing approach:
- Base materials established in Substance Painter
- Hand-painted details for storytelling
- Wear and tear focused on high-contact areas
- Metal variation for visual interest

## Final Thoughts

This piece explores the balance between hard-surface armor and organic cloth simulation, creating visual contrast and movement.
