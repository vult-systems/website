## Artistic Intent

An exploration of organic forms through procedural simulation. The goal was to capture the feeling of flowing water frozen in time.

## Technical Implementation

Built using Houdini's simulation tools:
- FLIP fluid simulation as base geometry
- VDB meshing for smooth surfaces
- Procedural color gradients based on velocity
- Custom shaders for iridescent effects

## Visual Development

The color palette evolved through iteration:
- Started with monochromatic tests
- Added iridescent effects for depth
- Finalized with subtle color variation
- Post-processing for mood enhancement

## Rendering

Octane renderer provided the look:
- Path tracing for accurate light transport
- Thin film interference for iridescence
- Volume scattering in surrounding space
- High-res output for print quality
