## Study Overview

A focused hard surface modeling study emphasizing clean topology, proper edge flow, and mechanical detail.

## Modeling Approach

Workflow priorities:
- Quad-based topology throughout
- Strategic edge loop placement
- Subdivision surface friendly geometry
- Booleans only where appropriate

## Detail Philosophy

Layered detail approach:
- Primary forms establish the design
- Secondary details add interest
- Tertiary details provide scale
- Surface detail through texturing

## UV Layout

Professional UV unwrapping:
- Logical UV shell organization
- Consistent texel density
- Minimal distortion
- Efficient texture space usage

## Texturing

PBR materials in Substance Painter:
- Base materials for different surface types
- Procedural wear and tear
- Decals for visual interest
- Final details hand-painted

## Takeaways

This study reinforced the importance of planning topology early and maintaining clean geometry throughout the modeling process.
