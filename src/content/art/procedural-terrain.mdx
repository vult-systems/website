## Project Goals

Create a fully procedural terrain generation system that can produce varied, realistic landscapes while remaining artist-directable.

## System Architecture

The generator consists of several modules:
- Height field generation with noise
- Hydraulic erosion simulation
- Sediment deposition
- Vegetation scatter system
- Material blending based on slope

## Technical Challenges

Key problems solved:
- Performance optimization for real-time use
- Artist control vs procedural variation balance
- Realistic erosion patterns
- Seamless tiling for large worlds

## Implementation

Built using Houdini's Height Field toolkit:
- Custom HDAs for tool ecosystem
- Parameter-driven for art direction
- Export pipeline to game engines
- LOD generation for distance

## Results

The system successfully generates varied terrain while allowing artists to guide the overall aesthetic through intuitive controls.
