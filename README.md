## Development Approach

This site is being built through **vibe-coding** with AI assistance. As a 3D artist exploring modern web development, I'm testing the capabilities of AI-powered development tools to bridge knowledge gaps and accelerate learning.

I understand the trade-offs: less manual control, potential over-reliance on generated code, and the importance of understanding what's being built. But for creative experimentation and rapid prototyping, this approach lets me focus on design and content while exploring new technologies.
